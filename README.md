OpenRelay.js is a JavaScript library for interfacing with OpenRelay.xyz and
other 0x Standard Relayer API providers.

It is currently in pre-release development, and targets an earlier draft of the
Standard Relayer API. It should work with OpenRelay.xyz, but will not work with
other Relayers until a future update. It is intended that code written to
OpenRelay.js should continue to work after the switch to the finalized Standard
Relayer API, but we can't make such guarantees at this point.
